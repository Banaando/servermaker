# Server Maker
This program will attempt to make setting up a Minecraft server as easy and pain-free as possible.  
  
**Usage -** Download the latest release of the .jar file, download and edit the sample config included with the release, and either download and run the start script ([RunServerMaker.bat for Windows](https://github.com/Banaando/servermaker/releases/download/0.0.1/RunServerMaker.bat) and [RunServerMaker.sh on macOS / Linux](https://github.com/Banaando/servermaker/releases/download/0.0.1/RunServerMaker.sh)) or run this in a Command Line or Terminal in the same folder as the other files where you want the server to be located:
```
java -jar ServerMaker-<version>.jar
```
